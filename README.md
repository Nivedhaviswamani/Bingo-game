# Java Bingo Game

Welcome to the Java Bingo Game! This game allows two players to play against each other in a traditional Bingo format.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game requires two players. Each player will have their own Bingo card. The cards are randomly generated at the beginning of the game.

2. **Gameplay**: Players take turns calling out numbers. If a called number appears on a player's Bingo card, they mark it. The goal is to mark a full line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the Bingo card.

3. **Winning**: The first player to mark a full line on their Bingo card shouts "Bingo!" and wins the game. The game ends when a player achieves Bingo.<br>
